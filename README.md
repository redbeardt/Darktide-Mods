# Redbeardt's Darktide Mods

## No Skull

Removes the skull icon that appears when you tag enemies. It gets in the way sometimes.

## Player Outlines

Enables the player to toggle the skeleton-hologram, a highlighted mesh, and an outline, as visual aids to ease identifying players.

## Status Colours

Lets you assign custom colours to the status icon indicating various player states (e.g. knocked down, hanging, pounced, etc.).
